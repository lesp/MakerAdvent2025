All of the code for the days of MakerAdvent 2025

## Day 14 ESP32 C3 Super Mini IoT Doorbell
Building on the introduction of the £6 trio of ESP32 C3s, day 14 puts one of them to use as an Internet connected doorbell. Using MicroPython and [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) we build a simple button circuit and use that to trigger a notifications via ntfy.

The circuit looks like this.

And these should be the only files in the root filesystem of your ESP32

## Day 18 CircuitPython MP3 Playback with Raspberry Pi Pico
Usign Adafruit's excellent [guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/mp3-playback-rp2040/pico-mp3) for MP3 playback on the Raspberry Pi Pico, their [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org) firmware and a reed switch, I make a simple sound box as a surprise present.

The circuit looks like this.

You will need both of the files, code.py and Christmas-low.mp3 on your Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Day 22 Showing Images and Playing Audio with QB64 Phoenix Edition

I do enjoy writing in BASIC and QB64 PE is a more modern interpretation of the language and it has great support for creating multimedia content.
In the Day 22 folder you will find all the project files, to recreate the project. Code, images and audio.

There is also the EXE file that I created in the video. This has been virus scanned and Malwarebytes reports that all is good!

Happy Hacking.
